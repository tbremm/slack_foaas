# slack_foaas
Slackbot for inappropriate API calls

# State of the Slackbot
Currently just works locally, but plans include adding slash commands, a menu; good stuff like that, so some kind of hosting is going to need to happen.

# Usage
In [main.js](https://github.com/tbremm/slack_foaas/blob/master/main/main.js), use the API arguments as the {2nd : n} arguments in the foaas.getFO() call. Then run.

This will currently only post in the #tb_dev channel.
